# Offline Ambient Noise Generator
A script to create ambient noise mp3's in Python.

Needs to be supplied with Samples.

You can find free ones online, record your own or generate different "colored" noises for this.

I will not provide any.






Place the script where you like and place the samples into a folder called "Sound Samples", the script will recurse through directories.






Have fun!
This is pretty WIP, expect it to be a little buggy.
